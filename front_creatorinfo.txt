<p>StartBCH.com was created by Reddit user <a href="http://reddit.com/u/writingabout">writingabout</a> after discovering that many people new to cryptocurrency were looking to learn how to begin. The question asked was "So how can I get started?". So then the project was started with the goal of answering that question. While creating the project it was discovered that many individuals have little to no access to the internet but can use the library or community center, and so the project is keeping that in mind too.
