<h2>What is StartBCH.com?</h2>
StartBCH.com is an educational resource that was created after learning that many people were asking how to get started with Bitcoin Cash who felt overwhelmed by too much information and conflicting information. The idea of the website was to load very fast even on old computers and slow networks. Another goal of the project was not to overwhelm someone new to cryptocurrencies with information-overload. The idea is to teach someone how to set up a very basic wallet (temporary web wallet) and learn the very basics no matter where they are in the world and to understand the viewpoint of someone very new to cryptocurrencies. From there they can research further and get more in-depth information and learn more about secure wallets and other more complicated aspects of Bitcoin Cash.
